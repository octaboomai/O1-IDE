## Month 1 — Stability + AI Layer Foundation

### v0.2.0 — AI Diagnostic Engine (Month 3–4 of original roadmap)

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Anomaly detection** | Battery drain, IMU drift, motor asymmetry, vibration FFT running on live telemetry |
| **Telemetry-to-code mapping** | AST parsing maps source code variables → MAVLink/ROS topics |
| **AI chat panel** | Context-aware sidebar chat using Claude Sonnet API |
| **Code review for robotics** | PID stability check, topic rate mismatch, safety bypass detection |
| **Flight log comparison** | Diff two `.bin` / `.ulg` files, AI highlights behavioural changes |

**Monetization trigger:** This is the paywall. Free tier gets telemetry. Pro gets AI.

## Month 2 — Deploy Pipeline

### v0.3.0 — One-Click Deploy

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| WiFi deploy | SSH + rsync from IDE to Raspberry Pi / Jetson |
| Deploy-aware AI | Watches telemetry post-deploy, flags regressions |
| Mission runner | YAML test missions, MAVSDK execution, AI analysis |
| Basic fleet view | N robots in grid, batch deploy |

---

## Month 3 — Full Studio

### v0.4.0 — Full Studio

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| PID tuning assistant | FFT analysis → gain suggestions → one-click redeploy |
| Pre-flight safety check | Battery, GPS, IMU calibration, geofence, failsafe |
| Gazebo integration | Headless sim in Docker, streamed to IDE panel |
| DGCA compliance | India-specific flight log format, logbook, no-fly zones |
| Multi-ROS distro | Jazzy, Iron, Rolling support (currently Humble only) |
