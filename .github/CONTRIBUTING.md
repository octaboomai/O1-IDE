## Pull Request Guidelines

1. **Branch naming:** `feat/...`, `fix/...`, `docs/...`, `chore/...`
2. **Commits:** Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
3. **Tests required:** New features need tests. Run `cd tests && yarn test`
4. **TypeScript:** No `any` without comment. Prefer explicit return types.
5. **One concern per PR:** Keep PRs focused and small.
